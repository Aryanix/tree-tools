{{page.description}}

Select the top level node(s) of one or more FoldingText outlines and run this script. 

The script will create a nested MultiMarkdown table with the same structure as the outline(s), placing the lines of MMD text in the clipboard, so that you can paste it elsewhere.

*Example of a source outline and the table generated from that outline by this script (previewed in Marked):*
