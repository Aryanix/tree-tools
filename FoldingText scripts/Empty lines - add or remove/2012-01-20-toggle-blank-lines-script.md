{{page.description}}

This script toggles the active FoldingText document between two states:

1. No blank lines at all
2. A blank line after every text line

In other words it either strips out every blank line in your text, or it separates all lines with a single space.

A spaced document is generally more readable, but a highly compact one can be useful at some stages of outlining, when you want to see as much as possible on the screen.

You can assign this toggle script to a hotkey with something like [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) or [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), and then use the hotkey more than once to alternate back and forth between two states of spacing.
