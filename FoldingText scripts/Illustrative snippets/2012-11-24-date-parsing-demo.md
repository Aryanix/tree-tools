{{page.description}}

Interactive Applescript demonstration of how informally entered dates can be converted to FoldinText's default format (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS)

Saves the keystrokes involved in:

- Moving to the start of the line,
- deleting any existing list or other formatting
- typing a #

(repeated keystrokes/runs will deepen the heading level).
