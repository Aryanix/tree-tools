This page contains some tips for using [FoldingText scripts](/posts/extensions/scripts).

First make sure that you have FoldingText open with a new test document. It's best to first try new scripts on a test document so that you can be sure that it works as you expect.

Next, open the "AppleScript Editor" application that's included on all Mac OS X computers, and paste the script code into a new "AppleScript Editor" window. Then press the green "Run" button and see if the script works.

## Install the Script

If you decide to keep the script you should install it so that it's easier to run.

1. Open the "AppleScript Editor" application and open it's general preferences pane. Make sure that "Show Script menu in menu bar" is checked.

2. Click on that new script menu item in your menu bar and choose "Open Scripts Folder > Open User Scripts Folder".

3. Save the script that you had open in "AppleScript Editor" for testing into that folder.

Once you've done this the script be listed in the Script menu in your menu bar. To run the script just select it from that menu. You can also use tools such as [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) and [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) to  setup keyboard shortcuts to launch scripts.
