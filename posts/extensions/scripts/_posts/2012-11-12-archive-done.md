{{page.description}}

This script is useful if you are using FoldingText to track todos and you need a record of what you've done. If you don't need a record then it's probably easiest to just delete done items, in which case you don't need this script.

To use this script first tag items that you are finished with with `@done`. Next run the script, and all of those items will be moved to the _Archive_ heading.
