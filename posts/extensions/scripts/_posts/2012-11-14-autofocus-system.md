title: Autofocus System
description: Use this script to implement a version of Mark Foster's autofocus time management system.
---

{{page.description}} The system is described on [Mark's site](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/).

The autofocus system is a paper based, but it can be implemented in FoldingText by using a new heading for each _page_, as shown in this example document.

    # Autofocus Page.todo
    
    - item 1
    - item 2
    - item 3

When you are finished with an item click the checkbox (created by .todo mode) to cross it off. If there's still more work to do on that item then click the item text to select it, and run the Autofocus Re-Enter script that's linked bellow. The item will be re-entered at the end of your list, automatically creating new _pages_ as necessary.
