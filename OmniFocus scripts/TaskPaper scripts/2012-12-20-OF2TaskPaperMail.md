title: OmniFocus to TaskPaper exporter
description: Creates TaskPaper formatted text from the current OmniFocus content panel selection.

{{page.description}}

Two applescripts which export whatever is selected in the right-hand content panel of OmniFocus to a plain Taskpaper format. (Any child nodes descending from the selection are also exported).

One script exports to a text file, the other exports straight to a fresh OS X Mail email.

(Drafted as a stopgap while the Omnifocus Taskpaper exporter remains buggy).

In addition to context and @done tags, it is also intended to output tags of the following form:

@start(yyyy-mm-dd) or @start(yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm) - Start date 
@due(yyyy-mm-dd) or @due(yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm) - Due date
@mins(nn) - Estimated minutes
@flag - Flagged
